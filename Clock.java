 * Title: Assignment 3-Clock.java 
 * Semester: COP3337 â€“ Summer 2019

 * @author Moises Feliz
 *
 * I affirm that this program is entirely my own work and none of it is the 
 * work of any other person.
 *
 * The program gets the current time of your location. It makes the current 
 * time a string, then the getMinutes and the getHour method splits them 
 * into substrings such that hours is a substring and so is minutes could be 
 * returned by each class. The SetAlarm() sets the hour and minutes of the 
 * alarm by getting them from the Clockdemo program and saving their values
 * in this program. The getTime method gets the current time string and 
 * returns it while also setting the alarm if there is one.
 * 
 * Part I: Implement a class Clock whose getHours, getMinutes and getTime
 * methods return the current time at your location. Return the time as a
 * string.
 *
 * There are two ways to retrieve the current time as a String:
 *
 * 1) Before Java 8 use new Date().toString() 2) With Java 8, you can use 3
 * classes in the java.time package: Instant, LocalDateTime and ZoneId. Here's
 * how you do it: String timeString = LocalDateTime.ofInstant(Instant.now(),
 * ZoneId.systemDefault()).toString()
 *
 * With either method, you'll need to extract the hours and minutes as a
 * substring.
 *
 *
 * Add an alarm feature to the Clock class. When setAlarm(hours, minutes) is
 * called, the clock stores the alarm. When you call getTime, and the alarm time
 * has been reached or exceeded, return the time followed by the string "Alarm"
 * and clear the alarm.
