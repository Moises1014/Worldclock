 * I affirm that this program is entirely my own work and none of it is the work
 * of any other person.
 * 
 * This class was made to show the time for the offset value. It first gets the 
 * the offset value from the ClockDemo class then saves it in this program
 * as a integer. The worldclock method is the constructor and also where it 
 * gets the offset value. This program is a subclass of the clock class so 
 * all the values from that class can be used here. This is used in getMinutes
 * method since the offset is in hours not minutes so it should be the same 
 * minutes as the superclass. The gethour first gets the hours from the super
 * class makes it an integer first then adds the off set time. After it gets
 * the new value makes it an string and returns it. The getTime method makes
 * a string time and initialize it first then adds the new hours and minutes to 
 * it.
 *
 *
 * PART II. Provide a subclass of Clock namded WorldClock whose constructor
 * accepts a time offset. For example, if you live in California, a new
 * WorldClock(3) should show the time in New York, three time zones ahead. You
 * should not override getTime.
